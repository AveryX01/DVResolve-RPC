# Discord Rich Presence for DaVinci Resolve

A simple tool written in **C#** to show your DaVinci Resolve project status on Discord.

This is a fork of the original [v4ish/DVResolve-RPC](https://github.com/v4ish/DVResolve-RPC) repo. I recompiled the DLLs to fix the "In Studio" typo issue.

The compiled files and executables are available for download. Just extract and run the exe.
